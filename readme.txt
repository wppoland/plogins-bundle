Sell product bundles and frequently bought together offers with an optional WooCommerce bundle discount.

== Description ==

Bundle adds a "frequently bought together" product bundle box to your WooCommerce product pages. Link any number of products to a product, set an optional bundle discount, and let customers add the whole product set to the cart in one click.

* A bundle box under the product summary that lists the bundled products.
* "Add bundle to cart" adds the main product plus every linked item at once.
* Optional bundle discount, applied either as a single cart fee or as a per-item price adjustment.
* An optional savings line that shows the bundle total and the amount saved.
* A `[bundle]` shortcode to place the bundle box anywhere, use `[bundle id="123"]` to target a specific product.
* Editable box title, button label and discount-line label, all translatable.
* Bundle definitions are stored as product meta, no custom database tables.
* Clean uninstall: removes its options and bundle definitions when deleted.
* One small stylesheet, no JavaScript on the storefront and no jQuery. Images reserve their space so the box does not shift the layout as it loads, and it follows the visitor's dark-mode preference.
* A "?" help bubble on every setting, reachable by keyboard, plus the box hides itself when a product has no bundle left to show.

Configure global behaviour under WooCommerce → Bundle. Link products and set the discount per product in the product editor's "Bundle" tab. Turn off "Show on product page" to render the box only where you drop the `[bundle]` shortcode.

= Does it require WooCommerce? =

Yes. WooCommerce must be installed and active.

= How is the discount applied? =

Choose between a single negative cart fee (one line in the cart) or a per-item price adjustment on each bundled product. Set this under WooCommerce → Bundle.

= Can a bundle include a discount? =

Yes. Set an optional percentage discount per product bundle. Bundle can show the bundle total and savings line before add to cart.

= Does the bundle add all products to the cart? =

Yes. The "Add bundle to cart" button adds the main product and linked products together.

= Does it create custom database tables? =

No. Bundle definitions are stored as product meta.

= Can I place the bundle box somewhere other than under the product summary? =

Yes. Use the `[bundle]` shortcode anywhere the current product is known, or `[bundle id="123"]` to render a specific product's bundle. Turn off "Show on product page" under WooCommerce → Bundle to use the shortcode only.

= Does Bundle use JavaScript on the storefront? =

No. The free bundle box is server-rendered with one small stylesheet and no storefront JavaScript.


= Does this plugin work on WordPress Multisite? =

Yes. This plugin is compatible with WordPress Multisite. Network activate it or activate it on individual sites; each site keeps its own settings and data.

== External Services ==

Bundle does not connect to any external services. It makes no remote API calls and sends no data off your site. Its only stylesheet and admin script are served from your own WordPress install (`assets/css/bundle.css`, `assets/css/admin.css` and `assets/js/admin.js`), with no third-party fonts, CDNs or analytics. All data stays in your database: global options in `bundle_settings` and `bundle_db_version`, and each product's bundle in the `_bundle_definition` post meta. The plugin sends no email.
